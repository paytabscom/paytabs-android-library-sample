How to integrate with samsungPay 
========

The following steps comprise the general process for integrating the Samsung Pay SDK with your app:
--------
1. Sign up for the [Samsung Pay Developers portal](https://pay.samsung.com/developers) by clicking SIGN UP and register your Samsung Account (or create it if you don’t already have one), then LOG IN.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions for adding your app and creating a new service to generate the SERVICE ID you’ll need to reference in your project code, along with a debug-api-key.
   Note The Service ID replaces Product ID as of SDK v1.4.

3. Download the Samsung Pay SDK.
   we are using one in our sample [Here](https://github.com/paytabscom/paytabs-android-library-sample/blob/sPaySample/app/libs/SamsungPaySDK_2.18.00.jar) 

4. Add the Samsung Pay SDK (samsungpay.jar) to your Android project using Android Studio.

5. Develop your partner app with the required API calls and callbacks for Samsung Pay integration.

 Note: From point 3 you can find an example in the [Sample app](https://github.com/paytabscom/paytabs-android-library-sample/blob/sPaySample/app/src/main/java/com/paytabs/pt2sampleapp/MainActivity.kt).
